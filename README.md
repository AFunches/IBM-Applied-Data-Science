# IBM Applied Data Science
**Building basic programs with data**<br/>
Most courses have bitesized projects including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, building a dashboard to visualize US Economic Data, and more.

The program consists of 10 online courses that will provide you with the latest job-ready tools and skills, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms. You’ll learn data science through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.  <br/>

Tools: Jupyter / JupyterLab, GitHub, R Studio, SQL, and Watson Studio <br/>
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc. <br/>
Projects: random album generator, predict housing prices, best classifier model, battle of neighborhoods <br/>

**Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python** <br/>
In course 5, you’ll get introduced to relational database concepts and help you learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get you started with performing SQL access in a data science environment. You’ll work with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets to create database instance in the cloud.

**Capstone project**<br/>
You will learn about location data and different location data providers, such as Foursquare. You will learn how to make RESTful API calls to the Foursquare API to retrieve data about venues in different neighborhoods around the world. You will also learn how to be creative in situations where data are not readily available by scraping web data and parsing HTML code. You will utilize Python and its pandas library to manipulate data, which will help you refine your skills for exploring and analyzing data.
